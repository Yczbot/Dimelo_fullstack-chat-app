# Dimelo 💬

Dimelo is my **first full-stack chat application**, built to learn real-time messaging, authentication, and modern web development. It uses **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Zustand**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, **Socket.IO**, and **Cloudinary** for image support.

This project helped me understand how frontend and backend connect, and how data flows in real-time apps. I'm proud to share this as the beginning of my development journey 🚀
